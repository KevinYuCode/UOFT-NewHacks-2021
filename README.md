# First Hackathon Ever
During Second Year of University three friends and I decided to participate in our first ever hackathon at UOFT New Hacks. We built a note sharing system where students could create personalized accounts and upload and share their lecture notes and homework files with one another. 

- We placed third overall in our first ever hackathon competition
